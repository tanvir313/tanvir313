### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tanvir Singh, a third-year CS student at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I'm passionate about all aspects and domains of software development. I have recently started learning about cybersecurity and I find security to be a very interesting field. I am currently looking for Summer 2024 Co-op opportunities. If you or anyone you know are hiring, I would really appreciate the help. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application in MVC .NET framework
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity concepts and tools.
